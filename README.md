# ðŸ§  Tokenizer â€” A Simple GPT-Style Tokenization Demo

This project is a **demonstration of how tokenization works behind the scenes** in GPT-like models.  
It allows you to see how text is broken down into tokens and how those tokens can be converted back into text â€” using a simple **character-to-token vocabulary**.
